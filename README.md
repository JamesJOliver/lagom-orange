# lagom-orange

> #### *Lagom* is a Swedish word with no direct English equivalent, meaning "just the right amount". Orange is an English word which describes the colour between red and yellow. This colour was named after the fruit and not the other way round.

lagom-orange, is a [Jekyll][j] blog theme with just the right amount of style. This theme is based on [lagom][lg] by [Matt Swanson][ms] and is lovingly extracted from both [mdswanson.com][mds] and [james12802.co.uk][jam] for your enjoyment!

* Responsive, based on [Skeleton][skeleton]
* [Font Awesome][font-awesome] for icons
* Open Sans from [Google web fonts][gfonts]
* Built-in Atom RSS feed

## Installation

### For Linux/Mac

- Install Jekyll: `gem install jekyll`
- [Fork this repository][fork]
- Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USER/lagom-orange`
- Run the jekyll server: `jekyll serve`

### For Windows

Installation on Windows is quite a bit tougher, so I have writen a whole [post][post], just on installation instructions.

### And serve!

Either way, you should now have a server up and running locally at <http://localhost:4000>.

## Customization

Next you'll want to change a few things. Most of them can be changed directly in
[_config.yml][config]. That's where you can add your social links, change the accent
color and other cool stuff like that.

There's a few other things you'll want to change, too:

- [CNAME][cname]: If you're using this on GitHub Pages with a custom domain name, 
  you'll want to change this to be the domain you're going to use. All that should 
  be in here is a domain name on the first line and nothing else (like: `example.com`).
- [favicon.png][favicon]: This is the icon in your browser's address bar. You should 
  change it to whatever you'd like.
- [logo.png][logo]: A square-ish image that appears in the upper-left corner

## Deployment

You should deploy with [GitHub Pages][pages] - it's just easier.

All you should have to do is rename your repository on GitHub to be
`username.github.io`. Since everything is on the `gh-pages` branch, you
should be able to see your new site at <http://username.github.io>.

## Licensing

[MIT](https://github.com/james12802/lagom-orange/blob/master/LICENSE) with no
added caveats, so feel free to use this on your site without linking back to
me or Matt Swanson and without using a disclaimer or anything silly like that. (But if you like the theme, it never hurts to say where you got it! ;p)
